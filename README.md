# Library System

<strong>IT Tralee: Year 2 Semester 2</strong>

The motivation of the proposed idea was to implement functionalities of a Library System that can be utilized by librarians. The proposed design and implementation contains the following features:

* Member CRUD operations, e.g. member registration, remove member from register, update member profile and member listing.
* Book management, e.g. insert and remove book to/from database, update book's information and book search functionality. 
* Loan management, e.g. record and update loans when books are borrowed or returned.
* Financial management, e.g. record and update fines, and perform revenue analysis.
